## Preparing: 

### IRB Training

Welcome to joining our lab! 

The first thing is to get the Institution Review Board (IRB) training certificate before you can run experiments at NYU Shanghai.

Here is what you need to do: 

At NYU Shanghai, educational training has been assured for all research personnel who are involved with human research subjects by completing an on-line program through CITI **www.citiprogram.org**.

If you are a new CITI learner, please go to [www.citiprogram.org](http://www.citiprogram.org/), on the upper right hand corner of the screen, click on “Register.” The registration process will walk you through 7 steps. In the registration process, please affiliate with **New York University**.

Then choose and complete "**biomedical research**". After you pass all the questions, save an electronic copy of the completion certificate, click on "**Print Report**." The report will open up as a PDF document which then can be saved.

Email our lab manager this certificate as soon as possible and we will add you to our IRBs.
